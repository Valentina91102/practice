        <h1>Magic Kingdom</h1>

        <p>Magic Kingdom is a theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida, near Orlando, Florida. Owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Parks, Experiences and Products division, the park opened on October 1, 1971, as the first of four theme parks at the resort.

            The park was initialized by Walt Disney and designed by WED Enterprises. Its layout and attractions are based on Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California, and are dedicated to fairy tales and Disney characters.
            
            The park is represented by Cinderella Castle, inspired by the fairy tale castle seen in the 1950 film.
            
            In 2019, the park hosted 20.9 million visitors, making it the most visited theme park in the world for the thirteenth consecutive year and the most visited theme park in North America for at least the past nineteen years.

        <h1>Lands</h1>

        <p>
            Magic Kingdom is divided into six themed "lands." It is designed like a wheel, with the hub in front of Cinderella Castle. Pathways spoke out from the hub across the 107 acres (43 ha) of the park and lead to these six lands. The Walt Disney World Railroad circles around the entire 1.5-mile (2.4 km) perimeter of the park and makes stops at Main Street, U.S.A., Frontierland, and Fantasyland
            </p>

        <h2>Main Street, U.S.A.</h2>
        
        <p>Symbolically, Main Street, U.S.A. represents the park's "opening credits," where guests pass under the train station (the opening curtain), then view the names of key personnel along the windows of the buildings' upper floors.

            Taking its inspiration from New England to Missouri, this design is most noticeable in the four corners in the middle of Main Street, where each of the four corner buildings represents a different architectural style.
             </p>
        
        
        <h2>Adventureland</h2>
             <p>Adventureland represents the mystery of exploring foreign lands. It is themed to resemble the remote jungles in:
             </p>
            <li>Africa</li>
            <li>Asia</li>
            <li>Middle East</li>
            <li>South America</li>
            <li>South Pacific</li>


        
         <h2>Frontierland</h2>
            <p>In Frontierland guests can relive the American Old West, from the romanticized cowboys and Native Americans, to exploring the mysteries of the Rivers of America.
